## Development Process
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Request Process
1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Update the documentation if needed
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Create a pull request!
